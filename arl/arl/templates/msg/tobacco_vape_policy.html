    <h1>Required Action Policy for Tobacco and Vape Products</h1>

    <h2>1. WHAT IS REQUIRED?</h2>
    <p>To comply with federal and provincial tobacco regulations, you must request ID from anyone purchasing tobacco or vape products who looks to be younger than 40.</p>

    <h2>2. WHY?</h2>
    <p>To ensure we are not selling tobacco or vape products to minors. It is against the law to sell tobacco or vape products to minors. A person who distributes tobacco or vape products to a minor is guilty of an offence and could be punished with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loss of employment</li>
        <li>Personal fines ranging from $4,000 to $100,000</li>
        <li>Loss of license to sell tobacco and vape products</li>
        <li>Additional fines ranging from $10,000 to $150,000 (for the Associate)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. WHO?</h2>
    <p>Each and every Guest that wants to buy tobacco products.</p>

    <h2>4. REQUIRED ACTION</h2>
    <p>Guests that look under the age of 40 are asked for (picture) I.D. when purchasing tobacco products:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask for (picture) I.D. if they look under 40 before quoting the price of tobacco products.</li>
        <li>Ask for (picture) I.D. if they look under 40 before placing tobacco products on the counter.</li>
        <li>Don't let an angry Guest stop you from asking for (picture) I.D. IT'S THE LAW!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. I.D. THAT MAKES THE GRADE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Driver's license</li>
        <li>Certificate of Canadian Citizenship</li>
        <li>Canadian permanent resident card</li>
        <li>Canadian Armed Forces I.D. card</li>
        <li>Any document issued by a federal or provincial authority or a foreign government that contains a photo, date of birth, and signature</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> School I.D. cannot be accepted as proof of age.</p>

    <h2>6. EXPECTED RESULTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No Employee is charged with selling tobacco products to a minor.</li>
        <li>Employees always remember to ask for I.D.</li>
        <li>No Employee receives a warning letter about selling to a minor.</li>
        <li>Employees are supported by the manager for asking ALL Guests for I.D. who want to buy tobacco products.</li>
    </ul>
